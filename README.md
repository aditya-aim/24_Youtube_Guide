   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-youtube-guide.git
   cd ai-youtube-guide
   ```
   
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies:
   ```text
   streamlit
   openai
   ```
   Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configuration:**
